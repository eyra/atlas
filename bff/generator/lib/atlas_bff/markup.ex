defmodule AtlasBFF.Markup do
  @moduledoc """
  The rules of markup, as functions: part of the format, so of the generator, not of a
  contract. The server target refuses bad markup with them; the client target leaves it
  out; the TUI renders the tree. A client in another language implements the same rules;
  these functions and their tests say what they are.

  A view model is its content, a flat list of blocks with stable ids, and its markup: a
  list of entries `%{"kind" => kind, "start" => id, "end" => id, "props" => %{}}`, plus
  `"group"` on the pieces of one split entry. An entry covers the blocks from `start` to
  `end`, both included. Entries point at ids, never at positions, so inserting, deleting
  or moving a block never shifts the others' markup.

  All markup nests, of every kind, as in XML: two entries either do not share a block, or
  one covers all of the other. Entries with the same stretch nest in list order, the first
  outermost. Markup that would cross is placed as pieces that share a group (`place/3`).

  Functions take `ids`, the content's block ids in order, and `markup`.
