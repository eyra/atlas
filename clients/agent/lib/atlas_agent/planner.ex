defmodule AtlasAgent.Planner do
  @moduledoc """
  Who plans a request: the one place that knows (UC-Atlas-16). The environment's
  settings choose it, under `"agent"`:

  - `"planner": "claude"` (also when unset): a local headless Claude session
    (`claude -p`). Its only tools are `atlas help`, `atlas get` and `atlas list` on the
    same environment, so it can read Atlas and change nothing. `"model"` picks the model.
  - `"planner": ["<command>", "<arg>", ...]`: any command. It gets the planner's input as
    JSON on stdin and prints the plan as JSON on stdout. The end-to-end test uses a
    scripted stand-in this way, so CI needs no model.

  `"name"` names the planner for its users (a plan says who made it); `"timeout_seconds"`
  is how long it may take, 300 by default.

  The input: `%{"request", "env", "page", "tools"}`; `page` is the view model of the page
  the request was made on, `tools` are `AtlasAgent.Tools.list/1`. The answer:
  `%{"summary" => text, "steps" => [step]}`, the steps as `AtlasAgent.Plan` takes them.

  A planner only proposes. Nothing it answers is run before a user accepts it; the
  Runtime of SC-Atlas-02 will take this place later.

    You plan changes in Atlas for Melle. He is on a page of Atlas and asked, in his own words:

    #{input["request"]}

    You propose; you never change anything yourself. Your answer is a plan: steps, each one call of a tool below. Atlas shows the plan to Melle, and he keeps, edits or drops each step before anything runs. Propose only what the request asks for. When there is nothing to do, answer no steps and say why in the summary.

    To read more of Atlas you may run only these commands, always with --env #{env}, each on its own: no pipes, redirections, `cd` or `&&`, which are refused. Anything else you run is refused too.
    - atlas get <key> --env #{env} --json      one item, and what hangs under it
    - atlas list <kind> [--in <key>] --env #{env} --json
    - atlas help [<kind>] --env #{env}         every kind: what a create asks, its fields

    The page he is on, as Atlas's Control sends it (its blocks):
    #{JSON.encode!(input["page"])}

    The tools a step may use:
    #{JSON.encode!(Enum.filter(input["tools"] || [], &(&1["tool"] in ["put", "set"])))}

    A step is {"tool": "put", "kind": <kind>, "in": <the key of the item it goes in, when the tool has "in">, "values": {<field>: <text>}, "why": <one sentence>} or {"tool": "set", "key": <key>, "values": {<only the fields that change>: <text>}, "why": <one sentence>}. Use only fields the tool asks for. Ids are made by Atlas: never give one. Write titles and descriptions in the language and style of the items on the page; a title says what, without a code. The summary says in one or two sentences what the plan does.
